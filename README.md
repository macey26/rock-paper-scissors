### Alex the Kidd Jenkan Game
Made for the The Odin projects Paper Scissors project.

I was originally going to use the basic rock paper scissors them for the game, until i remembered that Alex the Kidd was one of my favourite games growing up and one of the main challenges was to win Jenken games to get to the next level. So I decided when learning DOM manipulation to use the Alex the Kidd theme. Most of the images were recreated to suit the game.

It took weeks to complete which was longer than expected but I felt a sense of nostalgia to get the game right.
